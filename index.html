<div id="messagediv" class="">An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.
  
  I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.
  
  When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.
  
  Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. You’re disgusting.
  
  Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right?</div>
